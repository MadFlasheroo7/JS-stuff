It is also good at IO intensive Jobs despite being single threaded language, it achive this by the help of **event loop** it can queue up work in background. optionally js/ts also supports **OOP** patterns. JS also supports async process with the help of **Promise** api.

Server Side application using **nodejs**
Mobile application using **React or Ionic**
Desktop application using **Electron**
